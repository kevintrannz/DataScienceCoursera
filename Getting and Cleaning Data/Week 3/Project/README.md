#Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
This repository contains the R code and documentation files for the Coursera Data Science's track course 'Getting and Cleaning data'.

Information about the dataset that has been used can be found here: <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones">Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones</a>

#Files
This code takes for granted that the code is present in a folder in this same folder named `UCI HAR Dataset`.

`Codebook.md` contains a description for all the variables, data and any transformations or work that was performed.

`run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the analyses described in 5 steps. 

The output of the 5th step from the `run_analysis.R` file is called `data_AVG.txt`. This is uploaded in the
root folder of the current directory.
